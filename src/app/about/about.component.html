                <p>I was self-employed in the catering industry for over 20 years. I operated several ice cream parlors in and around Munich. Then I switched to the field service for a wholesaler and have been working there for 2 years.</p>

                <p>In 2018 I started studying business informatics alongside my job. During my studies I came into contact with topics such as digitization and software engineering. This is where I discovered my passion for programming. In 2021 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science. Then I visited an institution in Munich to develop myself further in front end development.
